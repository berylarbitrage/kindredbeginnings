          {SITE.brand} connects generous people with the families who need their help. We recruit
          and pre-screen egg and sperm donors, and guide them through every step of the process with
          care, honesty and respect.

        <h2 className="text-primary pt-4 text-3xl font-semibold italic">What we believe</h2>
        <ul className="marker:text-accent list-disc space-y-3 pl-6 text-base leading-relaxed">
          <li>
            <strong>Informed choice.</strong> Donors deserve clear, balanced information — including
            the risks — before making any decision.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Fair, transparent compensation.</strong> Compensation recognizes your time and
            commitment. It is never based on appearance, ethnicity, or other personal traits.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Privacy first.</strong> Your personal and health information is protected and
            never sold.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Real support.</strong> Every donor has a dedicated coordinator — a real person
            you can call or text.
          </li>
